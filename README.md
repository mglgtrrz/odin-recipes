# odin-recipes

This exercise serves to cap off the html basics section of the Odin project course. Here, I was instructed to create what is essentially a collection of recipes that are compiled into a single homepage that links to separate pages, each containing individual recipes in detail. As a creative flourish, I decided to cover semi-fictitious recipes featured in the anime Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill. I say "semi-fictitious" as you can easily replace the fantasy-element ingredients with real-world equivalents so as to come up with an actual dish.

On the technical side, I was able to apply the basic elements of html, such as setting up the boilerplate and the various elements that allow for the presentation of text (e.g. headers, paragraphs, means which to render text in boldface or italics whether with semantic implications or not). As far as visual design goes, I am able to just put effort in that front at the moment through the <img> element. Lastly of course, no recipe is complete without the application of listing elements, both ordered and unordered.

Concurrently, this also helps put into practice the git-related administrative work when it comes to making gradual progress, changes, and/or additions to a project.

From what I understand going through this section of the Odin Project, I'll be returning to this repository for further refinements on the visual side. We'll see in due time.
