        <h1>Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill</h1>

        <p>
            Unwittingly summoned to another world, Tsuyoshi Mukouda has nothing but the clothes
            on his back and the ability to order mail from his favorite grocery back in Japan. 
            Now calling himself Mukohda, he finds that this otherworld is teeming with monsters. Denizens of this 
            world fend for themselves with sword and sorcery, but former-salaryman Mukohda can only bring to bear 
            an assortment of wares and ingredients from Earth!
        </p>

            Life isn't easy for Mukohda. Or at least it wouldn't be, had he not met Fel, a legendary fenrir and unimaginably 
            powerful. He is also a glutton. With the promise of Mukohda's Earth-inspired cooking, Fel readily agrees to be his
            familiar, with a peculiar slime Sui later joining them as familiar (and glutton) number two. And just like that,
            their lives are that of absolute safety and- more importantly- good eats!
