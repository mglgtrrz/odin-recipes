        <h2>Not quite parent ("oya") and child ("ko"), but fenrirs and slimes don't sweat the details</h2>
        <p>
            A Rockbird is an elephantine monster that might make you think of a rooster slowly but surely
            taking evolutionary steps back to becoming a T-rex. Unsurprisingly, this otherworld bird is an
            ornery foe that even intermediate adventurer parties only have a <em>chance</em> of winning against.
        </p>
        <p>
            All that said, to Fel the fenrir, a Rockbird may as well be another chicken on the chopping block.
            Needless to say, Rockbird poultry is a delicacy. For an exhausted Mukohda, all that's left is to
            buy some eggs from Earth's grocery, and some hearty recovery food won't take long!

        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Thinly slice the onion, and cut the Rockbird meat into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Crack open eggs into a bowl and lightly whisk.</li>
            <li>In a deep enough pan, mix together the dashi, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Bring 
                to a strong simmer under high heat.</li>
            <li>Add in the Rockbird and onions to cook through, taking around 5 to 7 minutes for thigh meat
                or 3 to 4 for breast meat. During the cooking process, make sure all of the meat pieces are
                sufficiently submerged in the broth and then cover with a lid.</li>
            <li>Turn down to low heat and pour in half of the whisked eggs. Cover once more with a lid
                and allow to further cook for around 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take off from heat and pour in the remaining whisked eggs. Cover once more with a lid
                and allow it to cook in residual heat for another 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Plate on top of a bowl of freshly cooked rice and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
