        <h2>Not quite parent ("oya") and child ("ko"), but fenrirs and slimes don't sweat the details</h2>
        <p>
            A Rockbird is an elephantine monster that might make you think of a rooster slowly but surely
            taking evolutionary steps back to becoming a T-rex. Unsurprisingly, this otherworld bird is an
            ornery foe that even intermediate adventurer parties only have a <em>chance</em> of winning against.

            All that said, to Fel the fenrir, a Rockbird may as well be another chicken on the chopping block.
            Needless to say, Rockbird poultry is a delicacy. For an exhausted Mukohda, all that's left is to
            buy some eggs from Earth's grocery, and some hearty recovery food won't take long!
