        <h2>Such an easy yet filling meal, a certain fenrir and slime have no beef ("gyu") with it</h2>
        <p>
            A wyvern is a large dragonoid to be feared in the otherworld. Typically seen in groups, a flight
            of wyverns can all too easily spell the ruin of even a well-defended town. They have knife-sharp
            teeth. They wield poisonous stingers. They fly. No surprises there, really.
        </p>
        <p>
            To Fel the fenrir and Sui the (freakishly strong) slime, a flight of wyverns is a convenient way 
            to get large amounts of high-quality marbled meat all at once. For this, Mukohda's Earth cooking 
            repertoire has just the thing! More importantly, it's fast and simple- all the easier to sate 
            his pair of gluttons.

        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Separately, cut the wyvern meat and onions into thin slices. If you have fresh ginger
                instead of the tubed kind, now is also the time to finely grate it.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine water, sake, soy sauce, and sugar. Bring to a light simmer under
                medium heat and then add the ginger.</li>
            <li>Add in the onions and stir for around 5 minutes or until the onions soften.</li>
            <li>Add in the Wyvern meat and gently stir for 5 more minutes. Scoop out any scum
                that floats to the surface.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat and cover with a lid, letting it sit for another minute or two.</li>
            <li>Plate on top of a bowl of rice and dig in!</li>
        </ol>
