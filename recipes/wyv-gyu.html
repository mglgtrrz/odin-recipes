        <h2>Such an easy yet filling meal, a certain fenrir and slime have no beef ("gyu") with it</h2>
        <p>
            A wyvern is a large dragonoid to be feared in the otherworld. Typically seen in groups, a flight
            of wyverns can all too easily spell the ruin of even a well-defended town. They have knife-sharp
            teeth. They wield poisonous stingers. They fly. No surprises there, really.

        <p>
            To Fel the fenrir and Sui the (freakishly strong) slime, a flight of wyverns is a convenient way 
            to get large amounts of high-quality marbled meat all at once. For this, Mukohda's Earth cooking 
            repertoire has just the thing! More importantly, it's fast and simple- all the easier to sate 
            his pair of gluttons.
