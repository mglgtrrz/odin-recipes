        <h2>A staple favorite of a certain voracious fenrir and slime</h2>
        <p>
            In the otherworld, Bloody Horn Bull and Orc General meat
            are top-shelf protein, indeed. Of course, one doesn't simply get their hands on such
            quality produce. Bloody Horn Bulls grow to the size of a rhino and travel in herds, each one
            with a violent temperament. The presence of an Orc General, a higher-form variant of
            the species, means that you're likely to face-off a veritable horde of orcs as a matter
            of course. Yep, good luck alright. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For Fel (a legendary fenrir) and Sui (an abnormally powerful slime), however, procuring these
            ingredients is just another light workout. Then with Mukoda's repertoire of Earth's cuisine
            and his access to Japan's grocery offerings, what you get is comfort food with a literal
            twist of fantasy. Unreasonable you say? Bah, it's freaking delicious, so don't think about
            it too deeply!
        </p>

        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince onions.</li>
            <li>In an oiled pan, saute the minced onions under medium heat. Once it starts to brown, take
                the onions off the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large enough bowl for all your patty ingredients, first soak the panko crumbs
                with the milk. Then add in the ground meat mix and the sauted onions. Crack open the egg
                into the mix and top the whole thing off with a seasoning of salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Knead the combined ingredients to get a uniform mixture.</li>
            <li>With the mixture, form the patties to your desired size. <i>Pro-tip: you can
                minimize air pockets in the patties by lightly tossing them between your hands as
                they are shaped. That way, it minimizes the risk of them breaking when being cooked.</i></li>
            <li>Oil up the pan again and get it to temperature on medium-high heat. Lay out the patties
                on the pan to get a sear on each side.</li>
            <li>Once both sides are seared, turn heat down to medium and pour a little amount of water enough to
                thinly coat the surface of the pan. Then cover with a lid and allow the patties to steam for around
                2 to 3 minutes (depending on thickness).</li>
            <li>Once cooked, take patties off the heat for plating.</li>
            <li>With the same pan, turn heat down to low and mix in the ketchup and worcestershire sauce.
                Stir the blend for around a minute or two and then turn off the heat. Either drizzle the
                sauce over the patties or prepare in a separate bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy your finished hamburger steaks with your favorite side. Rice, fries- they all pair
                perfectly!</li>
