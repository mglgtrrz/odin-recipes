        <h2>A staple favorite of a certain voracious fenrir and slime</h2>
        <p>
            In this otherworld, Bloody Horn Bull and Orc General meat
            are top-shelf protein, indeed. Of course, one doesn't simply get their hands on such
            quality produce. Bloody Horn Bulls grow to the size of a rhino and travel in herds, each one
            with a violent temperament. The presence of an Orc General, a higher-form variant of
            the species, means that you're likely to face-off a veritable horde of orcs as a matter
            of course. Yep, good luck alright.

            With Fel (a legendary fenrir) and Sui (an abnormally powerful slime), however, procuring these
            ingredients is just another light workout. With Mukoda's repertoire of Earth's cuisine
            and his access to Japan's grocery offerings, what you get is comfort food with a literal
            twist of fantasy. Unreasonable you say? Bah, it's freaking delicious, so don't think about
            it too deeply!
